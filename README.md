It will show you the washroom near you with a certain distance.
https://zehaol.github.io/lab2new/ 4.I used help on P5js, leaflet and Truf. i used turf to create the point of the location of the person. and used buffer to make a certain distance that they could travel. then i used points within the polygon to find out the Washrooms with in a certain distance. And I checked other student's idea on Geos 472 web page to give me some inspirition. I also used Rothâ€™s article for me to figure out the color theme and visualizations that i want to make. But in the map making progress, a bug happend.

I don't have the knowledge to fix it. you can see it from the screenshot. The soul buttom "find" (function findd)have three lind of // codes. I believe those are the right codes to use, but they just don't work with my project for some reason. I feel so bad about this. Since that is the most useful application in the web map. So i desicide to make a sample find for a location with 2000m radius.

I made this map for all people in Vancouver to find a public washroom. People like me often feel ill if I can not find a bathroom to use. There are 5 function of the map. First, Show all Bathroom buttom. we could see all the public washrooms in vancouver. Second, draw point buttom. If you input the latitude and longtitude of your position. Your location will be pinned on the web map. Third, Hightlight buttom. This works the same as the leaflet activity on class. Just input the name in the adress name box and it will show you the bathrooms with that name. Fourth, Find buttom. This buttom is designed for you to find the bathroom that you need. If you input your location which are latitude and longitude, and you input the distance that you think you are able to make it in time. you will see selected washroom with a certain distance to your location. As i said before, I believe I wrote the correct code but some bug happend and I cant fix. So i just made up three inputs to show you what the function is limke. Fifth, the Clear all buttom. It will clear up all the information on the map. I followed and combined what we learnt in the last few weeks to make this map. Both Turf and Leaflet are invloved in it. I think letting people to put the range of the buffer by themselfes are better than setting one for them. Some people can hold themselves longer than others. So the capability input should be different for everyone. THis will make the audience to feel more connect to the map. I used all dark for the base map, that is because I think people using map might be felling nervous, stressful and anxious. Black will make them focus on the data and information that they need. So I think the color scheme will help the audience to catch the key information that they need.

Like I mentioned before, I will ask for help to fix this code to make the web map into a complete stage. Also if it is possible, I will make another input to input the time that the user is using the webmap. Some washrooms are not opreating at some specfic times. This might cause the audience to say bad things about the map if they run to a closed bathroom during their enmergency. I used the reading in the map designing progress. One of them is the aim of the map. i think this map is made for people to use and interact. So I did not care about fancy ananimation or pretty basemap.
